                        <p>Externally clocked 16 bit Linear Feedback Shift Register. The values at certain taps are xor'ed together and feed back into the shift register. The number of unique states should be 2^n -1. In this case 2^16 -1 = 65535. </p>

                        <p>Can be used to produce pseudo random patterns. In this case, the last 4 taps are output to the pins to produce random 4 bit patterns. To make this happen, we clock the LFSR 4x for every input clock so that all the bits in the nibble are pseudo randomized.</p>

                        <p>The sound you get from this sketch does have a frequency for the most part. Since it is clocked, the width of each cycle is based on that width, so this is by no means a white noise. Rather, the power would be distributed along the same fundamentals as a squarewave or..well..maybe like a counter that divs by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and so on. Its been decades since I have done the math, but you can get most of what I'm talking about by sampling the LFSR at a frequency and looking at its spectrum. It will look similar to the squarewave with peaks at 3f, 5f and so on. White noise is a flat plot.
                        </p>

                        <p>This does lead to an interesting effect though because you can tune the lfsr by changing the clock speed. Below is an example where a frequency ramp is put into the clock. You still hear the ramp...its just fuzzy. Very 8bit sounding</p>


                        <p> The sketch is equivalent to the following</p>
