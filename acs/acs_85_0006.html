                        <p>Basically, makes a fuzzy sounding square wave.</p>

                        <p><b>PB0</b> The first pin, PB0 is the pure squarewave. 50% duty cycle. This is calculated with counters that flip the bit every x interrupts.</p>

                        <p><b>PB1</b> PB1 is calculated the same way, except that in addition to the usual next count, a random number is added making the square a little longer or shorter. The number is found using the LFSR. so you are getting a fixed period +/- a random number. </p>

                        <p>On average, the length is what the first pin is set for, so they sound similar.</p>

                        <p><b>PB2</b> PB2 is a bit more deterministic in adding the length. It sounds a bit more like a fast ramp on the frequency. Each cycle is the previous count + 1 up to about 30 I think.</p>

                        <p>What you get is a square wave with some power in near frequencies. In this case, it sounds more fuzzy</p>
