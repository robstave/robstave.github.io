                        <p>Simple VCA </p>
                        <p> Lunetta Style VCA. Rather than controlling an input with a Control voltage...the control
                            voltage is Chopped up by the input. This only works with squarewave audio.</p>

                        <p>Again, its not like you can control a sine wave with a ramp. Instead, say you have a square
                            wave 440hz. The value of the input CV is reflected in the output as PWM AND its anded with
                            the input square.

                            Not amazing but effective in lunettas.

                        </p>

                        <p>Note, this is not a good sketch for LOW frequency values. The Interrupt is just listening for
                            changes in the state, so it is not particularly interested in the actual high/low value. If
                            this is what you need, then you should read the value.
                        </p>
                        <p>See a good example of this on
