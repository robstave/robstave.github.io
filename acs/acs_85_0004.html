                 Two vcos with an analog pin to select the range from one of 6 ranges.  High Freq 1, High Freq 2, Medium Freq 1, Medium Freq 2 and Low Freq 1 and 2.</p>

<p>You can change the values, but keep in mind the HF and MF counter is an Integer.
For the low frequencies, the code was placed in another loop.  Changing the int to a long did not work well and I could not get above 1.5Khz.  I think this is because the work in the interrupt handler for longs takes way more clock cycles.
I also ended up copying the counter code for the LFO branch rather than add complexity (and clock cycles) making a handler that looks tight.</p>
