                        <p> Two knobs.  One that plays a frequency and one that sets the length of the sample.
						The Sample loops continuously, and the write button over writes the loop with the value from the knob.</p>
						
						
						<p>The clear button writes zero into the address</p>
						
						<p> The same buffer is used for all cases, so the speed is really the speed that we traverse the buffer.  The
						sample value is held.</p>

						<p> It is similar to the Luna Mod sampler in a way.  This could use some improvement.  If you were to try and make this
						stand alone, I would use the ATTiny84 and upclock it bit.

						 <p>Its more of a starting block for your own adventures.  Maybe make the clear button capable of counts to toggle clear all 
						 or change it from a loop to a one shot?
